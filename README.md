# App Summary
The goal of this app is to help its users find horror movies that more align with their own tastes in horror movies. The app will include more horror movie genres than just the blanket genre of "Horror". For example, multiple horror subgenres could apply to The Shining, including Pyschological Horror or Paranormal Horror. The app also has tags for movies. For example, if a movie has a lot of jump scares, there is a "Jump Scare Heavy" tag that users can vote to apply to that movie. By adding tags and subgenres, users can find movies that more align with their horror movie tastes.

# Technologies Used
To build this app, I used React JS on the front end, Redux for state management, and NodeJS and PostgreSQL on the back end. I am also using The Movie Database free API. https://www.themoviedb.org/
